Welcome to the Reconstruction Toolkit (RTK)
===========================================

Here are suggested steps for the RTK beginner.

  1. Install the software following [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

  2. If you are not already familiar with ITK, [get started with ITK](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/blob/master/GettingStarted.md).

  3. Check out the [FirstReconstruction](examples/FirstReconstruction) example (both the [CMake](examples/FirstReconstruction/CMakeLists.txt) and the [C++](examples/FirstReconstruction/FirstReconstruction.cxx) codes). Many other examples are on the wiki using the applications (corresponding source code in the [applications](applications) subdirectory).

  4. Ask question to the [user mailing list](http://public.kitware.com/mailman/listinfo/rtk-users).
